		<p>
			This document defines a high-level RDF vocabulary for specifying the
			<em>shape</em> of RDF resources. The shape of an RDF resource is a
			description of the set of triples it is expected to contain and the
			integrity constraints those triples are required to satisfy.
			Applications of shapes include validating RDF data, documenting RDF
			APIs, and providing metadata to tools, such as form and query
			builders, that handle RDF data.

	<h1 id="intro">1. Introduction</h1>
	<div>

		<p>
			Linked Data has proved to be an effective way to look up and navigate
			information at web scale. It is also emerging as a compelling
			architectural basis for web applications [<a href="#RW-Linked-Data">RW
				Linked Data</a>]. The principles for designing Linked Data web
			applications are currently being elaborated by the W3C Linked Data
			Platform Working Group [<a href="#LDPWG">LDPWG</a>].
		</p>

		<p>
			RDF is at the core of Linked Data. The design principles for Linked
			Data [<a href="#Linked-Data-Design-Issues">Linked Data Design
				Issues</a>] include the following rule:
		</p>
		<blockquote>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful
			information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			This emergence of RDF as an important application development
			technology for Linked Data and other domains has brought to light a
			serious gap in the associated technology stack, namely the absence of
			a way to describe the integrity constraints imposed by an application
			on the RDF documents it processes. Here the term <q>integrity
				constraint</q> denotes any characteristic of data required by or
			enforced by an application. Common examples of integrity constraints
			include the mandatory presence of properties, the cardinality of
			relations, and restrictions on the allowed values of properties.
		</p>

		<p>Well-established programming technologies such as relational
			databases, object-oriented programming languages, and XML provide
			schemas or type definitions that encode integrity constraints.
			Programmers coming to RDF expect a similar mechanism, and frequently
			start to use RDFS or OWL for this purpose. However, this is a
			misapplication of those technologies.</p>

		<p>It is well-known that the semantics of RDFS and OWL are defined
			in terms of inference rules, not constraints. Reasoners will infer
			new triples in an attempt to satisfy RDFS or OWL ontologies.
			Sometimes this is exactly what a programmer wants, but if errors are
			present in the data, then the inferred triples will be nonsense and,
			worse, they may mask the presence of errors.</p>

		<p>
			This document describes the Resource Shape specification, a
			high-level RDF vocabulary for describing the <em>shape</em> of RDF
			resources. Here the term <q>RDF resource</q> is used to denote a
			resource that has an RDF document among its set of available
			representations. The term <q>shape</q> is used because it is often
			useful to visualize an RDF document as a topological object, namely
			as a graph consisting of nodes interconnected by arcs. Throughout
			this document the terms <q>RDF resource</q>, <q>RDF document</q>, and
			<q>RDF graph</q> are used more or less interchangeably albeit
			somewhat imprecisely.
		</p>

		<p>The shape of an RDF graph includes both a description of its
			expected contents (properties, types) within some operational context
			(e.g. GET, POST) and the integrity constraints that must be satisfied
			by the contents in that context.</p>

		<p>This document begins with a brief discussion of the use cases
			and requirements that the Resource Shape specification addresses. It
			then describes all aspects of the current specification in detail.
			Finally, it concludes with some recommendations for extensions based
			on implementation experience.</p>
	</div>

	<h1 id="uses-cases">2. Use Cases</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			This section briefly describes the main use cases for an RDF graph
			shape language. For a more complete discussion of this topic, refer
			to the W3C RDF Validation Workshop [<a href="#RDF-VAL">RDF-VAL</a>].
		</p>

		<h2 id="describing-apis">2.1 Describing RDF APIs</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Any application that provides programmatic services should
				also provide application programming interface (API) documentation
				to programmers so that they can consume those services. Applications
				that process RDF, including Linked Data web applications, are no
				different than other applications in this respect.</p>

			<p>Although API documentation is normally directed towards human
				programmers, there are also important use cases where other programs
				need to understand the API. For example, consider a generic
				form-building tool that can generate a user interface for creating
				or updating resources. Such a tool needs to understand the expected
				contents of the resource so it can generate a user interface. It
				also needs to understand the applicable integrity constraints so it
				can validate user input before sending it to the service provider.
				Furthermore, the service provide may apply different constraints for
				creation versus update operations.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 id="describing-datasets">2.2 Describing RDF Datasets</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Users must understand the contents of an RDF dataset in order
				to write SPARQL queries. Understanding the integrity constraints can
				help users write better SPARQL queries. For example, if a property
				is known to always be present, then there is no need to wrap it in
				an OPTIONAL clause.</p>

			<p>Query building tools can take advantage of shape information.
				For example, consider a query builder that allows the user to define
				a query that filters results by selecting allowed values from a
				list. In principle, the query builder could dynamically query the
				dataset to determine the list of values present. However, such a
				query could be slow if the dataset was large. In addition, only
				those values present at the time of the query would appear in the
				list. In contrast, if the query builder had access to shape
				information, then it could avoid the potentially expensive query and
				present the user with the complete list of allowed values, whether
				or not they were actually present in the dataset at that time.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 id="describing-indexable-data">2.3 Describing Indexable Data</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Resource indexers may be looking for certain types of
				structured data. For example, a web crawler might be indexing
				product descriptions and pricing for a marketplace application. The
				web crawler could provide a shape to describe the data it is looking
				for. Web application developers would then be able to provide that
				information in the web pages of their commerce site and thereby have
				their sites included in the index.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h1 id="requirements">3. Requirements</h1>
	<div>
		<p>This section describes some high-level requirements for an RDF
			resource shape language. For simplicity, members of a shape language
			are referred to as shape resources. It is to be understood that the
			validity and meaning of a shape resource depends on any other shape
			resources it is linked to.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A shape language must be able to express the most commonly
				occurring aspects of RDF resources in high-level terms, using
				concepts that are familiar to developers. Developers must be able to
				both understand existing shapes and author new ones.</li>
			<li>A shape resource must be processable using readily available
				RDF technologies. These include RDF parsers and SPARQL processors.</li>
			<li>The constraints defined by a shape resource must be
				verifiable using commonly available technologies, with acceptable
				performance. The performance criteria depend on the use case. For
				example, a tool checking user input must respond quickly. A tool
				validating an entire dataset may run as a batch job, but should
				complete within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. hours, not years).</li>
			<li>A shape language must be extensible so that
				application-specific aspects of resources can be expressed. A
				trade-off of expressiveness at the expense of ease-of-understanding
				is acceptable.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

			This section describes the Resource Shape 2.0 specification [<a
				href="#OSLC-Resource-Shape-2.0">OSLC Resource Shape 2.0</a>] (aka
			the <em>Shapes</em> specification) which is part of the OSLC Core 2.0
			specification [<a href="#OSLC-Core-2.0">OSLC Core 2.0</a>]. The
			Shapes specification defines:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the contents and meaning of shape resources, and</li>
			<li>how to associate shape resources with resources and services</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="overview">5.1 Overview</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				A resource shape is a resource that describes the contents of, and
				constraints on, the RDF representation of other resources. A shape
				resource itself has an RDF representation which uses the terms
				defined by the oslc: vocabulary. The term <q>shape resource</q> or
				simply <q>shape</q> is sometimes used as shorthand for the more
				verbose phrase <q>the RDF representation of a shape resource</q>
				where this can lead to no confusion. The following sections describe
				all of the RDF vocabulary terms used in shape resources.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Shapes specification is based on a simple conceptual model of
				resources that works well in practice, but is somewhat biased
				towards the view that the RDF representation of a resource looks
				like a set of property-value pairs on that resource. The Shapes
				specification works well when the resource being described appears
				as a subject node in its RDF graph and all other nodes are connected
				to the resource node by a path consisting of one or more properties.
				Each property-value pair is represented by a triple in which the
				subject is the resource, the predicate is the property, and the
				object is the value. The value may be either a literal or a
				resource. When the object is a resource, that resource may itself be
				described by another shape. Thus the Shapes specification is
				powerful enough to describe complex graphs. Although the Shapes
				specification works well in practice, it cannot describe arbritary
				RDF graphs. This limitation is discussed below in <a
					href="#recommended-extensions">Recommended Extensions</a>.
			</p>

			<p>The following diagram summarizes the main concepts and
				relations used in this specification:</p>
			<figure> <img src="shapes-overview.png" width="640"
				height="305" /> <figcaption>Figure 1. Diagram of main
			concepts and relations.</figcaption> </figure>
			<p>In this diagram the boxes represent resource types and the
				arrows represent the relations between them that are defined by the
				Shapes specification. The two boxes on the left represent external
				types of resources that use shapes. The other three boxes represent
				the resource types that are defined by the Shapes specification.</p>
			<p>
				The box labelled <q>Resource Shape</q> represents a shape. A shape
				is a resource of rdf:type <a href="#ResourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>.
				A shape describes a set of resources. A shape is basically a set of
				defined properties that any resource of that shape is expected to
				contain. A shape contains one or more defined properties.
			</p>

			<p>
				The box labelled <q>Property</q> represents a defined property. A
				defined property is resource of rdf:type <a href="#Property">oslc:Property</a>.
				The arrow labelled <q>property</q> represents the containment
				relation between a shape and its defined properties. The predicate
				of this relation is <a href="#property">oslc:property</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each <a href="#Property">oslc:Property</a> resource has a set of
				properties that describe the defined property and the constraints on
				its use within any resource of the given shape. These include a
				description of the values of the defined property and its occurrence
				within the resource. The value of a defined property may be a
				literal, a resource, or either. If the value of a defined property
				is a resource, then defined property may refer to another <a
					href="#ResourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a> resource that
				describes the value resource. This relation is depicted by the arrow
				labelled <q>valueShape</q>. The predicate of this relation is <a
					href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value of a defined property may be constrained to take one of an
				allowed set of values. In some cases, the allowed set of values may
				be large and be used in many shapes. In this case it is useful to
				put the allowed values in a separate resource so they can be easily
				reused. The box labelled <q>Allowed Values</q> represents a resource
				of rdf:type <a href="#AllowedValues">oslc:AllowedValues</a>. The
				arrow labelled <q>allowedValues</q> represents the relation between
				a defined property and its set of allowed values. The predicate of
				this relation is <a href="#allowedValues">oslc:allowedValues</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A REST [<a href="#REST">REST</a>] service may describe aspects of
				its interface contract using shapes. For example, a REST service may
				provide a URI where new resources can be created via HTTP POST. This
				service could describe the expected contents of POST request bodies
				using shapes. Similarly, a REST service may provide a URI that
				represents a container of resources and could describe those
				resources using shapes. The box labelled <q>any service</q>
				represents any REST service description. The arrow labelled <q>resourceShape</q>
				represents the predicate <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>
				which is a property of the service description resource.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, any resource can describe its own contents by linking to
				a shape resource. The box labelled <q>any resource</q> represents
				any resource. The arrow labelled <q>instanceShape</q> represents the
				predicate <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a> which is a
				property of the resource.

		<h2 id="associating-and-applying-shapes">5.2 Associating and
			Applying Shapes</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				This specification defines three ways to associate shapes with a
				resource, namely using <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a>,
				<a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>, and <a
					href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a>. Other specifications <span
					class="rfc2119">MAY</span> define additional mechanisms. In
				general, the relation between shapes and resources is many-to-many.
				Given a resource R there <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be zero or
				more shapes S associated with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all shapes associated with a resource are necessarily applicable
				to it. Let S be associated with R. S is said to <em>apply</em> to R
				in the following two cases:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Case 1: Generic Shape</dt>
				<dd>
					S applies to R when S has no <a href="#describes">oslc:describes</a>
					properties, in which case it is a generic shape and applies to any
					associated resource.
				</dd>
				<dt>Case 2: Typed Shape</dt>
				<dd>
					S applies to R when S is linked via <a href="#describes">oslc:describes</a>
					to a rdf:type T and R has rdf:type T.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If no shapes are associated with a resource then there are no
				implied constraints on that resource.</p>
			<p>
				If one or more shapes are associated with a resource then at least
				one of those <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be applicable to
				that resource. If no associated shape applies to a resource then
				this <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> normally be interpreted as
				an error condition.
			</p>
			<p>
				If exactly one shape applies to a resource then that resource <span
					class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> satisfy all the constraints defined
				by that shape.
			</p>
			<p>
				If more than one shape applies to a resource then that resource <span
					class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> satisfy all the constraints defined
				by all the shapes (AND semantics). However, the specification for a
				service description <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> define
				alternate semantics. For example, a service <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
				require that the resource satisfy the constraints defined by at
				least one of the shapes (OR semantics).

				If present and true, oslc:readOnly is used to specify that the value

				read-only. It cannot be directly modified by consumers of the
				service. Services <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> ignore
				attempts to modify read-only properties, but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
				fail such requests. If a service ignores an attempt to modify a
				read-only property then it <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
				do so silently. A service <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use the
				HTTP Warning header or some other means to indicate that the attempt
				to modify a read-only property has been ignored.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this context, modification means a change in any object of the
				triples associated with the defined property. For example, a GET
				request followed by a PUT request would not modify the triples. A
				service <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> interpret a PUT
				request that does not modify the triples associated with the defined
				property as a violation of the oslc:readOnly constraint.
			</p>
			<p>Examples of read-only properties include creation and
				modification timestamps, the identity of who created or modified the
				described resource, and properties computed from the values of other
				properties.</p>
			<p>When modifying a resource, it is natural for a consumer to
				first retrieve its current representation using a GET request. This
				request will return read-only properties along with read-write
				properties. If a service fails PUT requests that contain read-only
				properties then consumers will have to remove all read-only
				properties before submitting PUT requests. The behavior of ignoring
				read-only properties in PUT requests is therefore more convenient
				for consumers. Similarly, when copying a resource, a consumer would
				GET it first. It is therefore more convenient for consumers if the
				service ignores read-only properties also in POST requests.</p>

			specification in practice.</p>

		<h2 id="ext-vocabulary">7.1 ext: Extensions Vocabulary</h2>
		<div>
			<p>In the following sections the prefix ext: denotes the

				this specification will take place at W3C.</p>
		</div>

		<p>The implicit assumption that the described resource appears as
			a subject node works well when the described resource is implemented
			using common programming technologies. Most programming languages
			have the concept of a structure, record, or class which naturally
			maps to a resource. The fields of the structure, record, or class
			naturally map to property-value pairs which become triples in RDF.
			However, this assumption fails to capture the full generality of RDF
			in two important cases: inverse properties and disconnected graphs.
			The following section describes the inverse property case. The
			section after that describes the disconnected graph case.</p>

		<h2 id="inverse-properties">7.2 Inverse Properties</h2>
		<div>

			<p>In some cases the best RDF representation of a property-value
				pair may reuse a pre-existing property in which the described
				resource is the object and the property value is the subject. The
				reuse of properties is a best practice for enabling data
				interoperability. The fact that a pre-existing property might have
				the opposite direction should not be used as a justification for the
				creation of a new inverse property. In fact, the existence of both
				inverse and direct properties makes writing efficient queries more
				difficult since both the inverse and the direct property must be
				included in the query.</p>

			<p>For example, suppose we are describing test cases and want to
				express the relations between test cases and the requirements that
				they validate. Further suppose that there is a pre-existing
				vocabulary for requirements that defines the property
				ex:isValidatedBy which asserts that the subject is validated by the
				object. In this case there is no need to define the inverse property
				ex:validates. Instead the representation of test case resources
				should use ex:isValidatedBy with the test case as the object and the
				requirement as the subject. This situation cannot be described by
				the current Shapes specification.</p>

			<h3 id="isInverseProperty">7.2.1 ext:isInverseProperty Property</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					A simple fix for this limitation is to introduce a new optional,
					single-valued, boolean datatype property on <a href="#Property">oslc:Property</a>
					resources, e.g. ext:isInverseProperty. If present and true then the
					defined property is used in the opposite direction, i.e. the
					described resource is the object and the object resource is the
					subject.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2 id="disconnected-graphs">7.3 Disconnected Graphs</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				There is no requirement for a resource to be present as either the
				subject or object of any triple in its RDF representation. In
				practice the resource will appear as the subject in triples that
				describe the metadata of the resource, e.g. using terms from the
				Dublin Core [<a href="#DublinCore">DublinCore</a>] vocabulary.
				However, the resource may include other triples that are unrelated
				to the resource.
			</p>
			<p>For example, consider birth certificates. A birth certificate
				is an information resource that contains statements about real-world
				objects, namely people. Consider a birth certificate for John Doe,
				and suppose that the URI of the birth certificate is
				http://example.org/birthcerticate/johndoe. Further suppose that John
				Doe is identified by the URI http://example.org/id/person/johndoe.
				John Doe's birth certification might contain the following triples:</p>
			<figure>
			<div class="source">
				<pre>&lt;http://example.org/birthcertificate&gt; dcterms:created "2013-10-31T10:42Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
&lt;http://example.org/id/person/johndoe&gt; a foaf:Person ;
	foaf:name "John Doe" ,
	foaf:birthday "10-29" .</pre>
			</div>
			<figcaption>Listing 6. A disconnected graph.</figcaption> </figure>
			<p>The current Shapes specification is incapable of describing
				the birth certificate resource since the node for the person
				http://example.org/id/person/johndoe is disconnected from the node
				for birth certificate http://example.org/birthcertificate/johndoe.
				To work around this limitation, a resource designer is forced to
				introduce another triple as follows:</p>

			<figure>
			<div class="source">
				<pre>&lt;http://example.org/birthcertificate&gt; dcterms:created "2013-10-31T10:42Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
	foaf:primaryTopic &lt;http://example.org/id/person/johndoe&gt; .
&lt;http://example.org/id/person/johndoe&gt; a foaf:Person ;
	foaf:name "John Doe" ,
	foaf:birthday "10-29" .</pre>
			</div>
			<figcaption>Listing 7. A connected graph.</figcaption></figure>

			<p>Adding another triple to connect the graph works in this
				simple example, and, arguably, might be a better design. However,
				this approach may not scale to more complex graphs. Furthermore, the
				shape author may not have the ability to modify the resource design.
				It is therefore desirable to remove this limitation.</p>

			<h3 id="NodeShape">7.3.1 ext:NodeShape Class</h3>
			<div>
				<p>One design for handling disconnected nodes is to introduce
					new resources that describe them. Let ext:NodeShape be the rdf:type
					of a described node within the graph. The object of an
					oslc:valueShape property could be a resource of rdf:type either
					oslc:ResourceShape or ext:NodeShape.</p>
			</div>

			<h3 id="nodeShape">7.3.2 ext:nodeShape Property</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Let ext:nodeShape define the containment relation between a
					resource of rdf:type oslc:ResourceShape and a resource of rdf:type
					ext:NodeShape. A resource of rdf:type ext:NodeShape would itself be
					a shape except that it would not have ext:nodeShape properties,
					i.e. all disconnected nodes would be described at the top level of
					the graph.</p>

		<h2 id="datatype-facets">7.4 Datatype Facets</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The current specification only allows the use of a small number of
				XML Schema datatypes. In practice, it is often necessary to further
				limit the set of allowed values. The XML Schema Datatypes
				specification [<a href="#XML-Schema-Datatypes">XML Schema
					Datatypes</a>] defines a set of constraining facets which can be used
				to further restrict datatypes.
			</p>
			<p>For example, suppose it is required to restrict the decimal
				property ex:price to two digits of fractional precision. In XML
				Schema, this requirement can be satified through the use of the
				xsd:fractionDigits facet as follows:</p>
			<figure>
			<div class="source">
				<pre>&lt;xsd:element name="price">
	&lt;xsd:simpleType>
		&lt;xsd:restriction base="xsd:decimal">
			&lt;xsd:fractionDigits value="2" />
		&lt;/xsd:restriction>
	&lt;/xsd:simpleType>
&lt;/xsd:element></pre>
			</div>
			<figcaption>Listing 8. XML Schema xsd:fractionDigits
			facet.</figcaption></figure>

			<p>
				A straightforward way to extend the current Shapes specification is
				to allow XML Schema constraining facets as properties of datatype
				properties. The presence of a facet property would be defined as
				being semantically equivalent to using a restriction of the base
				datatype specified by <a href="#valueType">oslc:valueType</a>. The
				above ex:price example would be expressed as follows:
			</p>
			<figure>

				Here is the complete list of XML Schema constraining facets as
				defined in <cite>4.3 Constraining Facets</cite> [<a
					href="#XML-Schema-Datatypes">XML Schema Datatypes</a>]:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>xsd:length</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies the exact number of characters in a string value. The
					string value <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> contain the
					specified exact number of characters.
				</dd>
				<dt>xsd:minLength</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies the minimum number of characters in a string value. The
					string value <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> contain at least the
					specified minimum number of characters.
				</dd>
				<dt>xsd:maxLength</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies the maximum number of characters in a string value. The
					string value <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> contain at most the
					specified maximum number of characters. Equivalent to using <a
						href="#maxSize">oslc:maxSize</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>xsd:pattern</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies a regular expression for a string value. The string value
					<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> match the regular expression.
					<p>
						This facet bears further discussion. First, is XSD regular
						expression language identical to that used in the SPARQL regex()
						function? SPARQL uses the fn:matches() function which is defined
						in XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 [<a href="#XQuery-and-XPath">XQuery
							and XPath</a>]. Second, the SPARQL regex() function accepts flags as
						an optional third argument. An additional property,
						ext:patternFlags, should be used to specify these flags.
					</p>

				</dd>
				<dt>xsd:enumeration</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies set of allowed values. The value <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
					be contained in the specified set of allowed values. Not suitable
					for Shapes since it introduces complex XSD syntax and is redundant
					with <a href="#allowedValue">oslc:allowedValue</a>. Use <a
						href="#allowedValue">oslc:allowedValue</a> instead.
				</dd>
				<dt>xsd:whiteSpace</dt>
				<dd>Constrains how whitespace is handled in a string value. Not
					applicable to Shapes.</dd>
				<dt>xsd:maxInclusive</dt>
				<dd>Specifies the inclusive maximum for a numeric value. The
					numeric value must be less than or equal to the specified maximum
					value.</dd>
				<dt>xsd:maxExclusive</dt>
				<dd>Specifies the exclusive maximum value for a numeric value.
					The numeric value must be less than the specified maximum value.</dd>
				<dt>xsd:minExclusive</dt>
				<dd>Specifies the exclusive minimum value for a numeric value.
					The numeric value must be greater than the specified minimum value.</dd>
				<dt>xsd:minInclusive</dt>
				<dd>Specifies the inclusive minimum value for a numeric value.
					The numeric value must be greater than or equal to the specified
					minimum value.</dd>
				<dt>xsd:totalDigits</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies the total number of digits in a decimal value. The
					decimal value <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> contain at most the
					specified total number of digits.
				</dd>
				<dt>xsd:fractionDigits</dt>
				<dd>
					Specifies the number of digits in the fractional part of a decimal
					value. The decimal value <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> contain
					at most the specified number of digits in its fractional part.
				</dd>
			</dl>

		<h2 id="extending-shapes">7.5 Extending Shapes</h2>
		<div>
			<p>RDF specifications often support an open content model. For
				example, a bug tracking specification may define some base
				properties, such as severity and priority, but allow implementations
				to add custom properties, such as security impact and estimate cost
				to fix.</p>

			<p>Now suppose an implementation of some base specification
				provides a shape resource that describes the extended resource
				design. With the current Shapes specification, all of the defined
				properties of the base shape would have to be copied into the
				extended shape. Clearly, it would simplify maintenance of shapes if
				the extended shape could link to the base shape and only define the
				custom properties.</p>

			<h3 id="extendsShape">7.5.1 ext:extendsShape Property</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					The ext:extendsShape property links an extended shape to a base
					shape, e.g. a base specification shape. The meaning of this link is
					that all of the content of the base shape is effectively copied
					into the extended shape. The explicit content of the extended shape
					would override the copied content of the base shape. However, can
					should be taken to avoid violating the integrity constraints of the
					base shape. Any resource that is valid with respect to the extended
					shape <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also be valid with
					respect to the base shape. Validation with respect to the base
					shape <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> ignore the custom
					properties.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2 id="ldp-containers">7.6 Linked Data Platform Containers</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					The recent Linked Data Platform [<a href="#LDP">LDP</a>]
					specification defines resource containers. A resource container can
					describe itself using several properties, including
					ldp:membershipPredicate which identifies the property used for
					container membership.

				</p>
				<p>The oslc:isMemberProperty property was introduced for the
					benefit of query building tools and has little to do with RDF
					validation. Given that the LDP specification now serves the purpose
					of describing containers, it seems reasonable to deprecate the use
					of oslc:isMemberProperty.</p>
			</div>

			<h2 id="sparql-semantics">7.7 SPARQL Semantics</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					This specification uses natural language to define the semantics of
					shape resources. In many cases, the semantics could be expressed
					using SPARQL queries [<a href="#SPARQL-1.1">SPARQL 1.1</a>]. Using
					SPARQL would both improve the precision of the specification and
					provide a starting point for reference implementations and test
					suites. The use of SPARQL in this context does not imply any
					restriction on the choice of other implementation technologies.
				</p>

				<p>Given a shape and a described resource, it is of interest to
					determine if the described resource satisfies the constraints
					defined by the shape. Each constraint must be checked. If any
					fails, then the described resource does not satisify the shape.</p>
				<p>
					Many of the constraints can be expressed as SPARQL ASK queries.
					These queries return a true/false result. A query that returns true
					if the constraint is satisfied is called an <em>assertion</em>. A
					query that returns false if a constraint is satisfied is called an
					<em>exception</em>. Depending on the constraint it may be easier to
					express it one way or another. In addition, if a constraint is
					violated, then it is of interest to know how it is violated. A
					query that explains why a query is violated is called a <em>diagnostic</em>.
					Diagnostics can be expressed as SPARQL SELECT or SPARQL CONSTRUCT
					queries. If all assertions return true, all exceptions return
					false, and all diagnostics return nothing, then the described
					resource satisifies the constraints.
				</p>

				<p>For example, suppose we create an RDF dataset for the simple
					bug tracking described above. Each bug is stored as a named graph
					in the dataset. Consider the occurrence constraint on the
					oslc_cm:status property. This constraint states that the
					oslc_cm:status property occurs at most once in each bug. The
					following listing contains a SPARQL diagnostic query that returns
					all bugs that violate this occurrence constraint, along with the
					actual occurrence count:</p>

				<figure>
				<div class="source">
					<pre>prefix oslc_cm: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/cm#>

select ?bug (count(?status) as ?status_count)
where {
	graph ?bug {
		?bug a oslc_cm:ChangeRequest ;
			oslc_cm:status ?status
	}
}
group by ?bug
having (?status_count > 1)</pre>
